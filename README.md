# vlinux
My final project in the course Vlinux ht23.

Consist of:
  - a bash script to convert a log file to json with the help of regex+sed and awk
  - an Express/Nodejs based server that serves the data from the above json file
  - a command line client in bash for testing the server
  - a simple SPA webclient in vanilla js that uses the server
